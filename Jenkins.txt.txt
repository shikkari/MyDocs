One EC2 instance t1.micro -> ubuntu 16.04 -->security group (All TCP ports opened from Anywhere) -> use exisiting key pair
Open command prompt
CD to the directory where you have the AWS key file (Eg: xxxx.pem)
Right click on the EC2 instance you created ,click on connect and  copy the text which resembles below

ssh - i KEYPAIR.pem PUBLIC DNS XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

if it asks whether you need to add to known host,say yes

Now you will be inside the EC2 instance you created . Install Jenkins there

wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins-ci.org.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins

Find the public dns at thee lower pane of the EC2 instance

go to browser access url http://public_dns_instance:8080

Make sure jenkins console is launched

Jenkins when launched needs a random password to be input

Read the message on the jenkins console ,it asks you to read a text file and input that as the password

Once you enter the password, allow all reccomended plugins to install.
Once completed create a new root user account and password
Create a new free style project
Give a name
Add build step --> shell script --> type echo "Hello world"
Save/submit
Click on Run build now

If the result is blue --> success
Red --> fail


Adding a new slave:

On Slave:

Create a new EC2 instance (t2.micro)
Create a new user 
Enable password authentication as yes in sshd configuration
restart sshd service

On Master:

Go to manage jenkins
Manage Nodes
Give the labels
Give the host name details
Add remote temp directory as /tmp (Or anything)
Select launch method as SSH based
Add the credentials for the new user you created on the slave .
Lanuch the agent

Using Jenkinsfile (Pipeline Job)



on your git repo add a file name as Jenkinsfile(No extension)
Copy the content from below and commit
https://github.com/sumeshkanayi/com.mycom.bank/blob/master/Jenkinsfile
Since the above example showcases running python script (install python on jenkins master or slave)

sudo apt-get -y install python

create a new pipeline job 
In the pipeline section ,select pipeline from SCM,
Select SCM as git
give the url as your repo url
Save and build now 

Create a new dev branch make the changes there in Jenkinsfile .See if it works or not.. it wont work why?
Syntax : https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/


Multibranch pipeline
--------------------------------
Create a new multibranch pipeline job
click add source
give the git URL




Seed Job:


Install 
Job DSL plugin
https://jenkinsci.github.io/job-dsl-plugin/
In your git repo add a new file seed.groovy or any name you wish
Copy the content of https://github.com/sumeshkanayi/com.mycom.bank/blob/master/seed.groovy to it
Replace the github url with your repo url
Add build step as Process Job DSL
Give your repo clone url
Select Look on filesystem
In the DSL script section add seed.groovy
Save and build now
A new jenkins job will be created

Assigmnent

Create a new multibranch pipeline job using seed job
