Task: Deploy tomcat maven project to docker
Tool involved: git,jenkins,maven,docker,nexus(Optional),dockerhub


Fork this repository https://github.com/sumeshkanayi/Webapp.git
create a new Jenkins freestyle job ,it should do a maven clean install (Inovke top level maven target)
Install cloudbees docker build and publish plugin in jenkins
add a build step to tag and push the docker image to docker hub

Try building it will fail

Install docker on jenkins . https://get.docker.com/
try building it again it will fail 
 run the command sudo usermod -a -G docker jenkins (What does this command do?).Reboot ur docker instance
 build again
 On target docker host , find out which is the executable binary for docker service
 Edit the file and add the string to the line starting with "ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd " -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2735 (What does it do?)
 Now add another build step which will run a container on remote host

(In case if you have configured the jenkins to use nexus as a maven repo for depedency management and as artifct repo then make ure that
nexus is up and running in the network .If you are using nexus public IP in AWS under settings.xml of ur jenkins server (under jenkins
user home directory) make sure the new IP is updated there)
